## Parts

### Motor

The stepper motor used to turn the barrel is a Dual Shaft Nema 17 with a 20mm front shaft, 10mm back shaft and a body of 42x42x34mm although simelar motor sizes could work as long as they fit inside the barrel and body of a flap module.

A dual shaft motor is used so the mounting holes of the motor are freed and can be more easily used to mount the motor to the side of a module. A motor with a reversed shaft could also work.
